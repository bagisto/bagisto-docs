# Packages
[Laravel](https://laravel.com) packages are the primary way of adding functionality so the following features are distributed into packages to enhance the application and allow developers to follow the standard way of developing custom functionality.

- Theme
- Category
- Product
- Cart
- Checkout
- Payment

Service provider enables features such as loading [routes](/1.5.x/packages/routes.html), [migrations](/1.5.x/packages/create-migrations.html), [languages](/1.5.x/packages/lang.html) or publishing [views](/1.5.x/packages/views.html), etc so **Bagisto** is developed considering these aspects.
