## Introduction

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. Docker can also be used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using the Docker Compose tool.

With the help of Docker Compose, you can define containers to be built, their configuration, links, volumes, ports, etc., in a single file, and it gets launched by a single command. You can also add multiple servers and services just by adding them to the Docker Compose configuration file. This configuration file is in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

#### Application Data and Database Volume Persistence

It is recommended to keep your application files and database data volume on the Docker host and mount them on the running container. This ensures that the application and database data persistence even in the case of containers' failure or termination. In this way, even if you destroy containers, your data won't get lost unless you remove them forcefully.
This compose configuration file mounts the application directory **`app`** and database volume **`dbvolume`** from the host to running Docker containers at the time of containers' launch.

### Docker Setup for Bagisto

You can configure Bagisto using Docker in two different ways:

1. **Using Bagisto Docker Image from Docker Hub**
2. **Using Bagisto GitHub Docker Repository**

Both approaches allow you to set up the application quickly, managing all system requirements like Apache, MySQL, and PHPMyAdmin within isolated containers. Below is a detailed guide for each method.

### 1. **Using Bagisto Docker Image from Docker Hub**

Follow the steps below to set up Bagisto using Docker Hub. This approach provides a pre-configured Docker image of Bagisto, allowing for a quick and easy installation.

#### Step 1: Pull Bagisto Docker Image

To pull the Bagisto Docker image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull webkul/bagisto:2.3.0
```

#### Step 2: Run a New Container

Once the image is pulled, you can run a new Docker container using the command below. This will bind your local port 80 to the containerâ€™s port 80, so Bagisto can be accessed via the browser.

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 80:80 webkul/bagisto:2.3.0
```

> **Note:**
> If port 80 is already in use, you can try using a different port. For example, you can map port 8082 on your local machine to port 80 in the container by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker run -it -d -p 8082:80 webkul/bagisto:2.3.0
> ```
> After this, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8082/` instead of `http://localhost:80`.

#### Step 3: Access Bagisto in Your Browser

After the container is up and running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. This will load the Bagisto setup.

#### Step 4: Admin Login Credentials

Use the following credentials to log in to the Bagisto admin panel:

- **Admin Username**: `admin@example.com`
- **Admin Password**: `admin123`

### 2. **Using Bagisto GitHub Docker Repository**

#### System Requirements

The Bagisto GitHub Docker repository automatically handles the system requirements for running Bagisto, including the necessary Apache and MySQL configurations. Before proceeding, ensure that you have the latest version of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed. You can find installation instructions for your operating system at the following links:
- [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Docker Configuration

1. **Adjust Ports and Paths**  
   Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and configure the ports for Apache, MySQL, and PHPMyAdmin. You can also specify the volumes and MySQL credentials. Here's an example configuration:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.1'

   services:
       bagisto-php-apache:
           build:
               args:
                   container_project_path: /var/www/html/
                   uid: 1000 # Add your UID
                   user: $USER
               context: .
               dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
           image: bagisto-php-apache
           ports:
               - 80:80 # Adjust Apache port
           volumes:
               - ./workspace/:/var/www/html/

       bagisto-mysql:
           image: mysql:8.0
           command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
           restart: always
           environment:
               MYSQL_ROOT_HOST: '%'
               MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
           ports:
               - 3306:3306 # Adjust MySQL port
           volumes:
               - ./.configs/mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql/

       bagisto-phpmyadmin:
           image: phpmyadmin:latest
           restart: always
           environment:
               PMA_HOST: bagisto-mysql
               PMA_USER: root
               PMA_PASSWORD: root
           ports:
               - 8080:80 # Adjust PHPMyAdmin port

   volumes:
       mysql-data:
   ```

2. **Running the Setup**  
   After adjusting the configurations, execute the following command to start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   sh setup.sh
   ```

#### Accessing Bagisto

- **Admin Panel**  
  Access the admin panel at:  
  `http(s)://your_server_endpoint/admin/login`  
  Use the default credentials:
  - **Email**: `admin@example.com`
  - **Password**: `admin123`

- **Customer Registration**  
  Register and log in as a customer at:  
  `http(s)://your_server_endpoint/customer/register`
