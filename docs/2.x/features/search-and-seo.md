[[TOC]]

## Introduction

In this section, we're here to walk you through the seamless integration of Search & SEO elements into your fresh theme. We'll provide step-by-step guidance on how to align your theme with robust search functionalities and optimize it for superior Search Engine Optimization (SEO) performance.

Within this section, you'll find an option to access the search term history on your Bagisto e-commerce storefront. Additionally, you'll have the ability to create URL rewrites and manage search synonyms.

## URL Rewrite

The URL rewrite feature in a Bagisto e-commerce store allows developers to dynamically modify the URL structure of their e-commerce store. This functionality is particularly useful for creating more user-friendly and SEO-friendly URLs, as well as for managing redirects.

Through URL rewriting, developers can define custom URL patterns that map to specific routes or controllers within the application. This empowers them to create cleaner, more descriptive, and memorable URLs that enhance the user experience and make navigation more intuitive.

The URL rewrite capabilities often involve using the routing system to define rules for URL patterns and their corresponding actions. This enables the application to interpret and process user requests, redirecting or presenting content based on the rewritten URLs.

### Key functionalities of URL rewriting

**URL Redirects** : URL rewriting allows for setting up redirects from old URLs to new ones, preserving SEO value and ensuring a seamless transition for users and search engines.

**SEO Optimization** : By creating meaningful and keyword-rich URLs, developers can significantly improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of their application, potentially increasing its visibility in search results.

::: tip Note
During the URL rewrite process, you need to take care of your entered target path and the requested path.

Here are some required points for a URL rewrite. These are:

- **`For`** : Select the page for which you want to rewrite your URL (`Product`, `Category`, or `CMS Page`).
- **`Requested Path`** : Enter the current URL that you want to rewrite.
- **`Target Path`** : Specify the destination URL where you want your application to redirect.
- **`Redirect Type`** : Choose the type of redirection you prefer (`Temporary (302)` or `Permanent (301)`).
- **`Locale`** : Select the language/locale in which you want to apply the redirection.

## Search Terms

In the new version of Bagisto, we implemented a feature to collect search terms for SEO purposes or marketing, which involves setting up a system that tracks and stores the search queries made by users on your e-commerce store. This functionality is valuable for several reasons, primarily for SEO enhancement and marketing insights.

The feature aims to gather and record search terms used by visitors within your e-commerce store. This collected data serves multiple purposes:

Here's a breakdown of how this feature can be described:

1. **SEO Enhancement**: By analyzing popular search terms, the application can optimize its content, metadata, and keyword targeting, improving its search engine ranking.

2. **User Behavior Insights**: Understanding user search patterns provides valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends, aiding in marketing strategies and content optimization.


#### Implementation:

The implementation involves several key steps:

1. **Search Term Capture**: Configure your e-commerce store to capture and store search queries made by users. This can be achieved by logging or storing these terms in a database when users interact with the search functionality.


#### Benefits:

1. **SEO Optimization**: Leveraging collected search terms helps in preparing content and metadata to align with popular search queries, potentially boosting your e-commerce store's visibility on search engines.
  
2. **Marketing Insights**: Understanding user search behavior aids in crafting targeted marketing campaigns, content strategies, and product offerings aligned with user interests and demands.

## Search Synonyms

Now, you have the option to include search synonyms, which can drive traffic to your e-commerce store's products.

The feature is designed to broaden the scope of search queries by allowing the association of synonyms or related terms with primary keywords. This serves several purposes:

1. **Improved Search Relevance**: By linking synonyms to primary search terms, the application can return more comprehensive and relevant results, even when users input variations of keywords.

2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Offering expanded search results through synonyms ensures users find relevant content more easily, thereby improving satisfaction and engagement.

### Implementation
Implementing search synonym expansion involves the following steps:

1. **Synonym Management System**: Create a system within the Laravel app to manage synonyms. This system could include a database table or configuration file to associate synonyms with primary keywords.

2. **Search Query Processing**: Modify the search functionality to process both primary keywords and associated synonyms. When a user enters a search term, the system should query not only the primary keywords but also related synonyms linked to those terms.

3. **Mapping Synonyms to Primary Terms**: Develop logic to map synonyms to primary keywords. This could involve establishing relationships in the database or defining associative arrays to link synonyms to their corresponding primary terms.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Search Results**: By incorporating synonyms, the search feature provides a broader range of results, ensuring users find relevant content even if they use different but related terms.
  
- **User-Friendly Experience**: Improved search accuracy and broader search results contribute to a more user-friendly experience, increasing user satisfaction and engagement.

#### Customization and Optimization:
Consider offering an admin panel or interface where administrators can easily manage and update synonyms. Additionally, periodically analyze search data to refine and optimize synonym associations for better search performance.
