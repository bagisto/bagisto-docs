# Theme

In Bagisto, we offer a default theme for the front of your online store. This theme is made to look good and work well. But we know every business has its own style. That's why you can change things from the admin panel.

To change your store's theme, go to the admin panel and find the theme section. There, you'll see tools to help you change how your store looks. You can adjust colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand.

I've added a link to our [Bagisto demo](https://demo.bagisto.com/) website where you can see our default theme in action. Feel free to click the link and try it out. We're always working to make things better, so your feedback is important to us. Thanks for checking out our demo!

If you want to make a new theme, our theme section has guides for both the admin and shop. Whether you're changing your store's look or updating the admin panel, our guides will help you step by step. We want to make theme creation easy, so you can make Bagisto yours. Check out our theme section to start making your custom themes.
