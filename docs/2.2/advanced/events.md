# Events

[[TOC]]

## Introduction

Event Listeners in Bagisto are a way to implement the observer pattern, where listeners respond to events that occur in the application. Events can be thought of as announcements made by the application, and listeners are the actions taken in response to those announcements. All event classes in Bagisto are stored in the `Providers` folder, and the listeners are stored in the `Listeners` folder.

In Bagisto, events and listeners are organized in a clear and structured manner:

- Events are typically stored in the Events folder.
- Listeners are stored in the Listeners folder.

This organization makes it easy to manage and locate the event-driven components of your application.

To learn in detail about Controllers, you can visit the Laravel documentation [here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/events).

## Creating an Event Class

### Using Package Generator

If you have the Bagisto Package Generator installed, you can use the following command to create a new event class in the `packages/Webkul/Blog/src/Events` directory:

```sh
php artisan package:make-event BlogEvent Webkul/Blog
```

If the event class already exists, you can use the --force option to overwrite it:

```sh
php artisan package:make-event BlogEvent Webkul/Blog --force
```

Alternatively, if you don't have the package generator, you can create the file manually by creating a new class in the `packages/Webkul/Blog/src/Events` directory.

### Manually Registering Events

In Bagisto, you register events manually in the `boot` method of your `EventServiceProvider.php` file. Here is an example of how to register events:

```php
/**
 * Register any other events for your application.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function boot()
{
    //...

    Event::listen('event.name', 'path-upto-listener@function');
}
```

In this example, `event.name` is the name of the event, and `path-upto-listener@function` is the listener method that will handle the event.

### Manually Registering Listeners

When registering events, you specify the listener function to be executed when an event is triggered. Here is an example of how to register a listener:

```php
class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        //...

        Event::listen('checkout.order.save.after', 'Webkul\Admin\Listeners\Order@sendNewOrderMail');
    }
}
```

In this example, the `checkout.order.save.after` event will trigger the `sendNewOrderMail` method of the `Order` listener in the `Webkul\Admin\Listeners` namespace.

## Specifying Events

In Bagisto, events are typically fired before and after the execution of CRUD operations. This allows listeners to perform additional actions, such as logging, notifications, or data manipulation, at specific points in the lifecycle of an operation.

For example, you might have events fired during product creation, updating, or deletion. Hereâ€™s an example of firing events before and after saving an order:

```php
namespace Webkul\Sales\Repositories;

use Webkul\Sales\Contracts\Order;

class OrderRepository extends Repository
{
    public function create(array $data)
    {
        Event::dispatch('sales.order.create.before', $data);

        $order = parent::create($data);

        Event::dispatch('sales.order.create.after', $order);

        return $order;
    }
}
```
## Events Fired in Bagisto

    | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
    | bagisto.shop.layout.body.after | Listing this event to load css of shop layout. |
    | bagisto.admin.layout.head | Listing this event to load css of admin layout. |

## Listening to Existing Events

Bagisto uses events and listeners to implement the observer pattern, allowing you to respond to various actions and events within the application. You can listen to specific events and execute custom code when those events are triggered.

### Registering a Listener

Open the `EventServiceProvider.php` file located in the `Providers` directory of your Bagisto application. This file is where you register event listeners.

Inside the `boot()` method of `EventServiceProvider.php`, use the `Event::listen` method to register your listener. This method takes the event name and a callback function or a class method that will handle the event.

```php
Event::listen('checkout.order.save.after', 'Webkul\Notification\Listeners\Order@createOrder');
```

In the example above, we are listening to the `checkout.order.save.after` event and specifying the `createOrder` function from the `Order` listener class in the `Webkul\Notification\Listeners` namespace.

Replace `'checkout.order.save.after'` with the specific event you want to listen to. In this example, it listens to the event triggered after saving an order during checkout.

By registering the listener, you have associated the **`createOrder`** function with the **`checkout.order.save.after`** event. Whenever this event is triggered, the specified function will be executed.

You can modify the listener function according to your requirements to perform the desired operation.
