# Architecture concepts
**Bagisto** is very easy framework to understand. The goal of this document to give you overview of how bagisto works.

We love to work with hot [Opensource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) softwares so Bagisto is built on technologies such as [PHP](https://php.net), [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

As **Bagisto** targets e-commerce businesses so it provides front and back end features to enable customer account and administrative control simultaneously.

Laravel packages are being used to separate each functionality such as Category, Product, Cart, Checkout, etc.

We developed and used built-in components of Vue.js

**Bagisto** registers useful events that are triggered on most of the pages which could enable to perform some custom operations in the application.
