## REST API

The Bagisto REST API supports REST (Representational State Transfer) and provides access to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also supports pagination to increase the performance of the application. The Bagisto REST API can be used to build a PWA (Progressive Web Application) application, integrate an online shopping mobile application with the Bagisto store.
