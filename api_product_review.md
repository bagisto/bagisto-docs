## 1. Get All Bagisto's Reviews:
You can get all the reviews of the Bagisto Store. You can achieve this job by using **`reviews`** API call resource.
Currently, this **`reviews`** resource is helpful for both admin user and customer too. There is no need of customer authentication.

**Note: In the `reviews` resource API call, we used `GET HTTP verb` to get all the reviews of the Bagisto Store.**
