# The Bagisto Documentation

This documentation is rendered online at ***http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/introduction.html***(after serving)

Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.(more details refer to [https://jekyllrb.com/](Jekyll))

## Getting Started

You can build the doc locally but before you need to install some packages on your machine

* **Ruby**: may check through command if installed in your machine or not `ruby -v`

* **Gems**: may check through command if installed in your machine or not `gem -v`

### Steps to setup doc project on your machine

* Execute command `gem install jekyll bundler` in your terminal.

* Clone the 'Bagisto Docs' project from github.
