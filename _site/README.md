Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, which data gets displayed in the layout, and more.( for more details refer to [https://jekyllrb.com/](Jekyll))
